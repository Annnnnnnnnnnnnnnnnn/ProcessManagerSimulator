# ProcessManagerSimulator
A custom simulation of process manager written on C#
## DESCRIPTION
### Brief description
A test of implementing the basic work mechanic of processes managers (not actually implementing them).  
This is basically the Foreground Background algorithm. It suggests we have N queues. There the processes will be put on creating. 
Each process has a number associated with it, based on the actual order of the task appearance. There is also a hash-table containing pairs of
`process_number -> queue_of_the_process`.
